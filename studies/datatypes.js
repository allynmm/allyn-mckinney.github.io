/**
 * DATA TYPES
 * 
 * 0. Data types determine how to use certain pieces of code and how to achieve certain outputs.
 * 
 * 1. Data types are split into 2 groups: Simple/primitive and complex types. Simple types are immutable and are copied by
 * value; complex types are mutable, copied by reference, and can hold simple types.
 */

// 1. Simple data types
// Simple data types hold a definite size when stored in memory and cannot store or collect other values besides themselves.
    // They do not hold, collect, or aggregate other values, and operations on simple values return new simple values, they 
    // do not alter the original value (immutable).

    // Copy by value means that when assigning or passing, simple data types are copied from one value to the next.

// 2. Complex data types
// Complex data types can hold other complex data types
    // Aggregate other values and therefore are of indefinite size (mutable).

    // Copy by reference means that when assigning or passing, complex data types are passed by reference and can be changed 
    // in place without reassignment.

// 3. Number - Simple numeric data

// 4. String - Simple character data

    // Can use single or double quotes

// 5. Boolean - Simple; True or false

// 6. Array - Complex collection of related data
    // Zero-indexed list-like object

// 7. Object - Complex collection of related data
    // Store various keyed collections

// 8. Function - Complex; Set of statements that perform a task or calculates a value

// 9. Undefined - Simple; Represents an absence of value(s) - a given value does not exist

// 10. Null - Simple;  Represents an absence of value(s)

// 11. NaN - Not a Number

// 12. Infinity and Negative Infinity; Numbers that exceed the upper and lower limits for numbers
